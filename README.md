## ⚛️ React Fundamentals Used

This project demonstrates key React concepts, including:

- **Functional Components:** All components are implemented using React functional components for better readability and performance.
- **Hooks:**
  - `useState`: For managing local component states (e.g., dropdowns, form states).
  - `useEffect`: To handle side effects like initializing third-party libraries (e.g., AOS animations).
  - `useContext`: For managing authentication data using a custom `AuthProvider`.
  - `useNavigate`: This hook is used to programmatically navigate to different routes in the app. It's especially useful for redirecting users after actions like logging in or logging out.
  - `useLocation`: Used to get the current URL, which can be helpful for conditional rendering, like displaying different navigation options based on the user's route.
  - `useLoaderData`: Used to access the data loaded by the route's loader function in React Router. It allows components to retrieve preloaded data for a route, improving efficiency and enabling seamless server-client data fetching.
  - `useParams`: Used to access dynamic route parameters in React Router, such as :id or :category. It helps in extracting values from the URL, making it useful for tasks like fetching specific data or rendering content based on the current route's parameters.

- **React Router:**
  - Nested and dynamic routing for smooth navigation.
  - **Private Routes**: Only authenticated users can access certain pages.
  - Custom error handling page for unavailable routes using Error404 page.
- **Component Lifecycle:** Proper management of component mounting, updating, and unmounting using `useEffect`.
- **State Management:** Local state management for features like user authentication and form handling.
- **Context API:** Used for managing global user authentication state across the app.
- **Link and NavLink:** Used for managing global user authentication state across the app.
 - `Link`: A component used for navigation in React Router. It prevents page reloads and enables smooth transitions between routes.
 - `NavLink`: A component that is similar to Link but provides additional functionality such as adding an active class when the link is selected. This is useful for navigation bars or menu items to highlight the active route.
- **Props and Children:** Used for managing global user authentication state across the app.
 - `Props`: Properties that are passed into components to dynamically render content or configure behavior.
 - `Children`: In React, children is a special prop used to pass elements between the opening and closing tags of a component. This allows for reusable and flexible components.
